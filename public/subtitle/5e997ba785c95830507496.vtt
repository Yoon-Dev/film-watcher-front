00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:32.927
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:36.460
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.473
"l'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:41.032
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.511
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.673
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.910
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:52.011
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:55.546
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:59.117
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.928
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.833
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:11.198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:14.368
I mean, the way it is now,

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:17.242
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:19.372
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:22.475
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:26.784
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:30.314
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:33.362
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.990
"We got this guy's little girl.
If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.864
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

00:01:50.546 --> 00:01:54.243
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:57.309
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:00.356
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:02.857

easier than what we've been doing.

-No more liquor stores?
-What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:10.132
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.133
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.567
You tell 'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:16.571
They make it too personal.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.871
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:25.243
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:27.248
And if it's not the gooks,

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:29.944
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

What's wrong with that?

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:07.549

They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

liquor store we stuck up, remember?

- Yeah.

of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:10.715
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:21.773
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

00:11:21.843 --> 00:11:26.007
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.607
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

00:11:29.684 --> 00:11:34.587
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:36.748
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

00:11:36.824 --> 00:11:39.418
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:43.430
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

00:11:43.498 --> 00:11:46.433
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:50.267
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:54.604
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:58.543
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

00:11:58.613 --> 00:12:01.707
[ Scoffs ]
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

00:12:01.783 --> 00:12:04.445
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:08.751
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

00:12:08.823 --> 00:12:11.485
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:15.590
- Fuck you.
- [ Chuckles ]

00:12:15.663 --> 00:12:18.757
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:22.098
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.367
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.001
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:34.407
What time you got?

00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:36.609
7:22 in the a.m.

00:12:36.684 --> 00:12:40.245
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:51.595
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:54.863
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,

00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:57.666
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

00:12:57.738 --> 00:13:01.970
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

00:13:02.043 --> 00:13:07.003
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:11.711
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.

00:13:11.786 --> 00:13:15.517
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.683
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

00:13:17.758 --> 00:13:20.989
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

00:13:21.062 --> 00:13:26.125
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.603
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:33.469
You know what I'm sayin'?

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:35.475
It's an interestin' point.

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:37.477
Come on.
Let's get into character.

00:13:44.452 --> 00:13:46.420
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:49.513
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.823
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:58.855
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:02.300
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.895
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

00:14:04.972 --> 00:14:07.600
It is not a date.

00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:11.771
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:15.373
- It's just good company, that's all.
- [ Sighs ]

00:14:19.387 --> 00:14:24.151
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.
- [ Sighs ]

00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:34.359
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

00:14:34.428 --> 00:14:37.090
Hey, keep chillin'.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.068
You know who we are?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.099
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

00:14:50.177 --> 00:14:53.203
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:58.851
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

00:15:00.888 --> 00:15:03.914
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:08.325
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:10.226
don't ya, Brett?

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:11.958
Yeah, I remember.

00:15:12.032 --> 00:15:16.366
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:19.065
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:21.107
Hamburgers.

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:25.271
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:28.945
What kind of hamburgers?

00:15:29.016 --> 00:15:30.745
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:33.912
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

00:15:33.988 --> 00:15:36.786
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

00:15:36.857 --> 00:15:39.985
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.996
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:46.760
They're-- They're good.

00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:49.462
You mind if I try
one of yours?

00:15:49.536 --> 00:15:51.970
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

00:16:00.214 --> 00:16:02.079
Mmmm.

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:05.277
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

00:16:05.352 --> 00:16:07.877
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:11.414
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:14.928
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:18.829
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:22.027
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

00:16:22.102 --> 00:16:25.265
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:29.867
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

00:16:29.944 --> 00:16:32.003
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.106
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:39.641
You know why they call it that?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.780
Uh, because of
the metric system?

00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:47.156
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

00:16:47.227 --> 00:16:50.560
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.027
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

00:16:55.102 --> 00:16:57.036
Sprite. Good.

00:16:57.104 --> 00:17:00.972
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

00:45:57.512 --> 00:46:00.606
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

00:46:00.682 --> 00:46:03.742
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

00:46:03.819 --> 00:46:07.277
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

00:46:07.355 --> 00:46:10.017
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

00:46:10.091 --> 00:46:14.721
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

00:46:14.796 --> 00:46:18.527
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.194
But did it happen?

00:46:21.269 --> 00:46:27.105
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.

Really?

00:46:29.644 --> 00:46:32.977
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

except Marsellus and Tony.

[ "You Never Can Tell" ]

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:11.543
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

00:48:13.556 --> 00:48:17.515
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

And now the young monsieur

The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale

00:48:44.053 --> 00:48:47.955
But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well

C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

00:48:56.032 --> 00:49:00.401
They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast

00:49:02.438 --> 00:49:06.704
Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz

00:49:08.444 --> 00:49:12.540
But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:19.512
C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

- [ Vincent ]
I don't know. Some book.

- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

00:58:29.554 --> 00:58:33.650
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

- Get the fuck outta my way.

and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

00:59:04.555 --> 00:59:07.490
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:50.123

of adrenalin straight to her heart.

00:59:50.201 --> 00:59:53.136

You gotta pierce through that.
- [ Thumping ]

- I gotta-- I gotta
stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

00:59:59.711 --> 01:00:03.147
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

Hello, little man.

Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:29.430
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

over five years.

01:04:32.043 --> 01:04:33.977
Hopefully...

01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:36.980
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

01:04:37.048 --> 01:04:40.484
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

01:04:40.552 --> 01:04:43.350
for as long as we were,

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:47.721
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:49.726

01:04:51.062 --> 01:04:52.996
not made it,

I got something for ya.

01:05:14.385 --> 01:05:16.444
This watch I got here...

01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:21.322
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

01:05:21.392 --> 01:05:26.056
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:29.691
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

01:05:29.767 --> 01:05:32.702
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:35.933
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

01:05:36.007 --> 01:05:38.942
on the day he set sail for Paris.

01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:41.444
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

01:05:41.512 --> 01:05:44.879
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:48.510
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

01:05:48.586 --> 01:05:53.023
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

01:05:53.091 --> 01:05:57.528
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

01:05:57.595 --> 01:06:01.326
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

01:06:01.399 --> 01:06:04.857
This time they called it
World War ll.

01:06:04.936 --> 01:06:09.930
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:13.000
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

01:06:13.077 --> 01:06:16.012
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.107
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake lsland.

01:06:20.184 --> 01:06:23.119
Your granddad was facing death.

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:25.121
He knew it.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:29.125
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

01:06:29.193 --> 01:06:32.390
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

01:06:32.463 --> 01:06:37.696
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki--

01:06:37.769 --> 01:06:40.704
a man he'd never met before
in his life--

01:06:40.772 --> 01:06:43.741
to deliver to his infant son,

01:06:43.808 --> 01:06:48.404
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:52.813
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:57.150
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

01:06:57.221 --> 01:07:01.453
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

01:07:01.526 --> 01:07:03.460
This watch.

01:07:09.334 --> 01:07:14.772
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

01:07:14.839 --> 01:07:18.275
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:22.404
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.007
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:29.781
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

01:07:29.854 --> 01:07:33.790
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

01:07:33.858 --> 01:07:37.794
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something-- his ass.

01:07:37.862 --> 01:07:41.298
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

01:07:41.366 --> 01:07:45.564
Then he died of dysentery--
He give me the watch.

01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:49.504
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

01:07:49.574 --> 01:07:51.508
Then...

01:07:51.576 --> 01:07:55.637
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:57.647
now...

01:08:00.084 --> 01:08:03.019

Where did you get
this motorcycle?

01:50:19.988 --> 01:50:24.516
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

01:50:24.592 --> 01:50:28.358
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

Come on. Let's go,

01:50:35.403 --> 01:50:38.839
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we--

I'm sorry. Mmm.

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:55.956
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

01:50:56.024 --> 01:50:58.959
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:00.961
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

01:51:01.029 --> 01:51:02.963
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

01:51:03.031 --> 01:51:06.967
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

01:51:07.035 --> 01:51:09.970
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

01:51:10.038 --> 01:51:13.269
the single weirdest

I'll tell you all about it.

Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?

01:51:18.112 --> 01:51:20.706
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

01:51:20.782 --> 01:51:22.716
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

01:51:22.784 --> 01:51:25.344

- You read the Bible, Brett?

- [ Whimpering ] Yes!
- Well, there's this passage

I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

01:57:14.010 --> 01:57:16.945
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

01:57:17.013 --> 01:57:19.948
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.

01:57:20.016 --> 01:57:22.951
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

01:57:23.019 --> 01:57:24.953
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

01:57:25.021 --> 01:57:26.955
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

01:57:27.023 --> 01:57:30.186
Put yourself in his position--
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

01:57:30.259 --> 01:57:32.193
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

01:57:32.261 --> 01:57:35.196
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favor.

01:57:35.264 --> 01:57:39.200
If that favor means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favor straight up his ass.

01:57:39.268 --> 01:57:43.204
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

01:57:43.272 --> 01:57:46.207
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

01:57:46.275 --> 01:57:49.836
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

01:57:49.912 --> 01:57:51.846
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

01:57:51.914 --> 01:57:53.848
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

01:57:53.916 --> 01:57:56.851
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

01:57:56.919 --> 01:57:59.854
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

01:57:59.922 --> 01:58:04.018
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

01:58:04.093 --> 01:58:07.529
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

01:58:07.597 --> 01:58:12.057
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right?

01:58:12.134 --> 01:58:14.830
All right.
Fine. Fine.

01:58:14.904 --> 01:58:17.839
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

01:58:17.907 --> 01:58:20.842
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

01:58:22.578 --> 01:58:25.445

gourmet shit.

01:58:27.683 --> 01:58:29.617

would've been satisfied...

- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

01:58:42.965 --> 01:58:45.456
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

01:58:45.535 --> 01:58:47.469
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

01:58:47.537 --> 01:58:51.166
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:55.176
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

01:58:55.244 --> 01:58:57.405
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

When you came pulling in here,

01:59:02.985 --> 01:59:06.182
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

01:59:11.761 --> 01:59:14.491
No. I didn't.

01:59:14.564 --> 01:59:17.499
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- [ Sighs ] Why?

01:59:17.567 --> 01:59:22.095
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

01:59:22.171 --> 01:59:25.106
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker--
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

01:59:25.174 --> 01:59:29.611
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?

01:59:29.679 --> 01:59:32.910
No marriage counselor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

01:59:32.982 --> 01:59:36.349
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

01:59:36.419 --> 01:59:41.413
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

01:59:41.490 --> 01:59:43.583
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

01:59:43.659 --> 01:59:47.595
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

01:59:47.663 --> 01:59:51.622
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:59.434
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

01:59:59.508 --> 02:00:02.568
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

02:00:02.645 --> 02:00:05.705
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

02:00:05.781 --> 02:00:09.717
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

02:00:09.785 --> 02:00:12.720
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

02:00:12.788 --> 02:00:15.757
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

02:00:15.825 --> 02:00:18.760
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

02:00:18.828 --> 02:00:21.922
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

02:00:21.998 --> 02:00:25.490
Do me that favor, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

02:00:25.568 --> 02:00:28.503
Well, say she comes home.

02:00:28.571 --> 02:00:31.005
What do you think she'll do?

02:00:32.508 --> 02:00:34.942
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

02:00:35.011 --> 02:00:37.206
That ain't no kinda answer.

02:00:37.279 --> 02:00:40.339
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

02:00:40.416 --> 02:00:43.283
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

02:00:43.352 --> 02:00:45.286
this Bonnie situation is.

02:00:45.354 --> 02:00:49.290
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...

02:00:49.358 --> 02:00:51.292
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.420
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

[ All Gasping ]

02:00:56.599 --> 02:00:58.533
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

02:00:58.601 --> 02:01:01.195
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:04.205
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

02:01:04.273 --> 02:01:08.209
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.

02:01:08.277 --> 02:01:12.441
Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:15.678
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

02:01:15.751 --> 02:01:17.878
I'm on the motherfucker.

02:01:17.953 --> 02:01:23.016
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

02:01:23.092 --> 02:01:25.526
You sendin' the Wolf?

02:01:25.594 --> 02:01:27.789
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

02:01:27.863 --> 02:01:30.127
Shit, yeah, negro!

02:01:30.199 --> 02:01:33.327
That's all you had to say!

- When is she due?

Mm-hmm.

02:01:41.844 --> 02:01:43.778
Give me
the principals' names again.

02:01:43.846 --> 02:01:45.780

Place your bets.

02:01:46.849 --> 02:01:50.512
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:11.067
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

02:02:12.535 --> 02:02:14.969
[ Tires Screeching ]

[ Doorbell Rings ]

02:02:27.884 --> 02:02:30.819
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

02:02:30.887 --> 02:02:34.516
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

02:02:34.591 --> 02:02:37.526
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

02:02:37.594 --> 02:02:39.528
Uh, yeah. Please do.

02:02:39.596 --> 02:02:43.259
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

02:02:43.333 --> 02:02:45.767
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

02:02:45.835 --> 02:02:48.770
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

02:02:48.838 --> 02:02:50.772
Uh, one hundred percent.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:54.776
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
- Uh-huh.

02:02:54.844 --> 02:02:59.338
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

02:02:59.415 --> 02:03:03.715
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

02:03:03.787 --> 02:03:07.223
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:11.624
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

02:03:15.665 --> 02:03:17.599
[ Sighs ]

02:03:19.369 --> 02:03:21.303
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

02:03:21.371 --> 02:03:24.807
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

02:03:24.874 --> 02:03:28.310
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

02:03:29.779 --> 02:03:32.714
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

02:03:32.782 --> 02:03:35.342
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:40.856
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

02:03:40.924 --> 02:03:44.360
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? ls there gas in it?

02:03:44.427 --> 02:03:47.863
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

02:03:47.931 --> 02:03:51.367
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

02:03:51.434 --> 02:03:55.495
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

02:03:55.572 --> 02:03:57.597
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

- Thank you, Jimmie.

Mmm.

02:04:14.023 --> 02:04:16.150
Okay, first thing.
You two.

02:04:16.226 --> 02:04:19.161
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:21.959
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

02:04:22.031 --> 02:04:25.967
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

02:04:26.035 --> 02:04:29.471
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

02:04:29.539 --> 02:04:33.566
and clean the inside of the car--
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

02:04:33.643 --> 02:04:37.579
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

02:04:37.647 --> 02:04:40.582
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:43.585
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

02:04:43.653 --> 02:04:48.022
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

02:04:48.091 --> 02:04:52.187
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

02:04:52.262 --> 02:04:54.696
We need to raid
your linen closet.

02:04:54.764 --> 02:04:57.699
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

02:04:57.767 --> 02:05:01.396
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:06.773
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

02:05:06.843 --> 02:05:08.777
with quilts and blankets,

02:05:08.845 --> 02:05:12.781
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

02:05:12.849 --> 02:05:15.716
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

02:05:15.785 --> 02:05:17.844
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

02:05:17.921 --> 02:05:19.684
"Please" would be nice.

02:05:21.157 --> 02:05:24.092
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

02:05:25.995 --> 02:05:29.829
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

02:05:31.634 --> 02:05:34.569
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

02:05:34.637 --> 02:05:37.071
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:41.042
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

02:05:41.110 --> 02:05:44.443
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

02:05:44.514 --> 02:05:47.449
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

02:05:47.517 --> 02:05:50.315
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

02:05:50.386 --> 02:05:53.446
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

02:05:53.523 --> 02:05:58.153
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

02:05:58.227 --> 02:06:01.663
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:09.832
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

02:06:12.542 --> 02:06:15.238

the mess inside.

02:06:25.989 --> 02:06:28.423
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

02:06:29.926 --> 02:06:31.860

- I got it all here, but, uh,

02:06:43.206 --> 02:06:46.642
- Mr. Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:50.236
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

02:06:50.313 --> 02:06:52.247
Uh-- Uh, no,

02:06:52.315 --> 02:06:55.443
Uh, this is

02:06:55.518 --> 02:06:58.453
and it's, uh--
it was a wedding present...

from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

02:07:01.024 --> 02:07:05.461

- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

02:07:10.033 --> 02:07:14.936
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

02:07:16.072 --> 02:07:18.006
No.

02:07:18.074 --> 02:07:20.508
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

02:07:26.616 --> 02:07:30.882
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

02:08:01.050 --> 02:08:03.484
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

02:08:03.553 --> 02:08:06.989
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

02:08:07.056 --> 02:08:09.991
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

02:08:10.059 --> 02:08:12.994
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

02:08:13.062 --> 02:08:15.929

that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

02:08:15.998 --> 02:08:19.764
- on account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

02:08:19.836 --> 02:08:23.431
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

02:08:23.506 --> 02:08:26.942
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

02:08:27.009 --> 02:08:28.943
That's all.
I could blow.

02:08:29.011 --> 02:08:30.945
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

02:08:31.013 --> 02:08:33.948

In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:32.793
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

02:09:32.927 --> 02:09:35.225
- You know what you two look like?
- [ Vincent ] What?

02:09:35.296 --> 02:09:38.732
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

02:09:38.799 --> 02:09:42.166
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

02:09:46.474 --> 02:09:48.942
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

02:09:49.009 --> 02:09:53.446
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

02:09:53.514 --> 02:09:57.746
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

02:09:59.186 --> 02:10:01.120
- Vincent.
- [ Wolf ] Okay, gentlemen.

02:10:01.188 --> 02:10:04.680
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

02:10:04.758 --> 02:10:07.693
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

02:10:07.761 --> 02:10:10.992
Better you than me, gentlemen.
[ Chuckling ]

02:10:11.065 --> 02:10:14.000
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.
- [ Yelling Continues ]

02:10:14.068 --> 02:10:16.935
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

02:10:17.004 --> 02:10:19.905
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um--

02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:36.583
[ Wolf ] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

02:10:36.657 --> 02:10:39.922
[ Wolf Laughing ]
Perfect.

02:10:39.994 --> 02:10:43.452
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

02:10:43.531 --> 02:10:45.465
You guys look like--

02:10:45.533 --> 02:10:47.967
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

02:10:48.035 --> 02:10:51.630
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.
- [ Laughing ]

02:10:51.705 --> 02:10:55.197
- [ Both Laughing ]
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

02:10:55.276 --> 02:10:58.006
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

02:10:58.078 --> 02:11:00.012
Don't make me beg.

02:11:03.083 --> 02:11:06.519
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

02:11:06.587 --> 02:11:10.148
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

02:11:10.224 --> 02:11:13.159
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

02:11:13.227 --> 02:11:15.127
The place is North Hollywood,

02:11:15.195 --> 02:11:19.188
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

02:11:19.266 --> 02:11:22.599
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

02:11:24.004 --> 02:11:25.938
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

02:11:26.006 --> 02:11:29.942
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:33.104
- nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:36.115
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

02:11:36.183 --> 02:11:38.447
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

02:11:38.519 --> 02:11:40.953
Spoken like a true prodigy.

02:11:41.021 --> 02:11:44.457
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

02:11:44.525 --> 02:11:48.621
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

02:11:48.696 --> 02:11:51.631
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

02:11:51.699 --> 02:11:54.190
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

02:11:54.268 --> 02:11:57.203
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

02:11:57.271 --> 02:12:00.968
- [ Metal Door Slamming ]
- [ Engine ldling ]

02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:02.736
Outta my way, Rex.

02:12:04.311 --> 02:12:06.745
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

02:12:06.814 --> 02:12:10.580
- [ Vincent ] All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

02:12:10.651 --> 02:12:13.279
Someday all this will be hers.

02:12:13.354 --> 02:12:16.221
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

02:12:16.290 --> 02:12:19.726
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?
- [ Wolf Laughs ]

02:12:19.793 --> 02:12:22.227
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

02:12:22.296 --> 02:12:25.060
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

02:12:25.132 --> 02:12:26.497
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

02:12:26.567 --> 02:12:30.003
It's--
It's your future. I--

02:12:30.070 --> 02:12:32.834
I see a--
a cab ride.

02:12:32.906 --> 02:12:35.875
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

02:12:35.943 --> 02:12:38.878
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

02:12:38.946 --> 02:12:41.380
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

02:12:41.448 --> 02:12:45.384
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

02:12:45.452 --> 02:12:48.387
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

02:12:48.455 --> 02:12:50.389
Call me Winston.

02:12:51.959 --> 02:12:54.894
- You see that, young lady? Respect.
- [ Alarm Deactivates ]

02:12:54.962 --> 02:12:59.160
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

02:12:59.233 --> 02:13:03.260
- Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.
- [ Chuckles ]

02:13:09.843 --> 02:13:12.778
- [ Tires Screeching ]
- Wanna share a cab?

02:13:12.846 --> 02:13:17.112
- I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
- [ Phone Dialing ]

02:13:17.184 --> 02:13:19.982
Cool.

02:13:24.024 --> 02:13:27.118
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

02:13:27.194 --> 02:13:30.630
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

02:13:30.698 --> 02:13:33.132
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:35.634
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

02:13:35.703 --> 02:13:39.764
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:42.434
- [ Chuckles ]
- Want some bacon?

02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:44.443
No, man, I don't eat pork.

02:13:44.511 --> 02:13:47.947
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

02:13:48.015 --> 02:13:50.950
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

02:13:51.018 --> 02:13:52.952
I don't eat filthy animals.

02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:56.456
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

02:13:56.523 --> 02:13:59.458
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

02:13:59.526 --> 02:14:02.461
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

02:14:02.529 --> 02:14:05.464
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

02:14:05.532 --> 02:14:09.468
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

02:14:09.536 --> 02:14:13.870
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

02:14:13.941 --> 02:14:17.274
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

02:14:17.344 --> 02:14:20.279
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

02:14:20.347 --> 02:14:22.281
but they're definitely dirty.

02:14:22.349 --> 02:14:26.479
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

02:14:26.553 --> 02:14:30.114
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

02:14:30.190 --> 02:14:34.126
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

02:14:34.194 --> 02:14:38.221
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

02:14:38.298 --> 02:14:41.358
[ Both Laughing ]

02:14:43.837 --> 02:14:45.964
Oh, man, that's good.

02:14:46.039 --> 02:14:49.634
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

02:14:49.710 --> 02:14:52.702
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:55.214
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

02:14:55.282 --> 02:14:58.217
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

02:14:58.285 --> 02:15:01.550
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

02:15:03.457 --> 02:15:06.654
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:13.964
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

02:15:15.002 --> 02:15:16.936
But this morning...

02:15:17.004 --> 02:15:19.734
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

02:15:19.807 --> 02:15:23.504
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

02:15:23.577 --> 02:15:28.514
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.

02:15:28.582 --> 02:15:31.574
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

02:15:31.652 --> 02:15:34.086
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

02:15:34.154 --> 02:15:37.317
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

02:15:37.391 --> 02:15:41.157
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

02:15:41.228 --> 02:15:43.162
God got involved.

02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:44.959
But why?

02:15:45.032 --> 02:15:48.058
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

02:15:48.135 --> 02:15:51.104
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

02:15:51.171 --> 02:15:53.105
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

02:15:53.173 --> 02:15:55.835
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

02:15:55.909 --> 02:15:59.276
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

02:16:00.581 --> 02:16:04.813
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

02:16:04.885 --> 02:16:08.480
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

02:16:08.555 --> 02:16:11.649
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

02:16:11.725 --> 02:16:15.161
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:18.198
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

02:16:18.265 --> 02:16:20.529
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

02:16:20.601 --> 02:16:23.900
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

02:16:23.971 --> 02:16:28.908
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

02:16:28.976 --> 02:16:32.639
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

It's called a bum.

a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

Let me ask you something.

02:17:20.907 --> 02:17:23.034
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?

02:17:23.109 --> 02:17:27.045
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

02:17:27.113 --> 02:17:29.047

I never gave much thought
to what it meant.
