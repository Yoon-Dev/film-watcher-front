00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:27.114
Are we the first?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.470
Are we the first to arrive here?

00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:15.694
Is the interpreter with you?

00:03:16.665 --> 00:03:21.785
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.

00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:23.739
I'm a mapmaker.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.682
Can you translate
French into English...

00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:26.867
and English into French?

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:30.246
Yes, I explained to the team leader
in Villa Hermosa.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.226
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:01.335
They're all there. All of them.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.932
Check for landing marks.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.870
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks.

00:04:46.797 --> 00:04:49.717
M-447148.

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:54.305
W-445529.

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:57.975
Number 445529, check.

00:04:58.183 --> 00:05:02.730
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:04.938
447149, check.

00:05:05.024 --> 00:05:07.468
Tell me something.
What's happening here?

00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:10.128
It's flight number 19.
- 19 what?

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:12.209
It's that training mission from the...

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:14.308
naval air station
at Fort Lauderdale.

00:05:14.408 --> 00:05:17.311
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:19.980
Who flies crates
like these anymore?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.320
No one. These planes
were reported...

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.420
missing in 1945.

00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:31.882
But it looks brand-new.

00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.971
Where's the pilot?

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.851
I don't understand.

00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:43.812
Where's the crew? Hey.

00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:50.653
How the hell did it get here?.

00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:24.962
He says this guy's local.

00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:28.262
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

00:06:50.462 --> 00:06:52.462
Sunburn?

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.110
He says the sun came
out last night.

00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:14.862
He says it sang to him.

00:07:51.148 --> 00:07:53.509
Harry, keep an eye
on that point-out.

00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:55.611
He's on 122.5.

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:57.819
I'll be right back.

00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:03.674
Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.896
Air East 31, negative.

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:08.971
The only traffic I have
is a TWA L-1011...

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.110
in your 6 o'clock position...

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.420
...range 15 miles...

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.741
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in
your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:21.441
Stand by. I'll take a look at
broadband, over.

00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:25.291
Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.

00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:26.876
Air East 31, roger.

00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:30.129
I have a primary target
about that position now.

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:32.229
I have no known traffic.

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.711
Stand by, I'll check low, over.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:37.386
Check and see if
they know who it is.

00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:38.971
Center, Air East 31.

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.223
The traffic's not lower than us.

00:08:41.323 --> 00:08:45.243
He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:48.576
Air East 31,
can you say aircraft type?

00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:52.835
Negative, Center, no
distinct outline.

00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:57.114
To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.

00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:01.285
It has the brightest anti-collision
lights I think I've ever seen.

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:03.512
Alternating white to red.

00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:05.706
The colours are striking.

00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:09.059
Center, this is TWA 517.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.630
Traffic now looks lik e
extra-bright landing lights.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.250
I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.

00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:18.761
It could be a satellite.

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.805
I have a primary target now
in your 10 o'clock position...

00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:23.057
...five miles, over.

00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:25.434
Never seen anything like that.
- Affirmative, 31.

00:09:25.534 --> 00:09:27.779
The traffic is
proceeding northeast.

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:29.104
No altitude readout.

00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:32.274
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he'll be a problem.

00:09:32.374 --> 00:09:35.819
He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:37.655
Wait a second.

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:39.755
Stand by one.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.660
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.320
He's heading for my windshield.
We're turning immediately.

00:09:47.973 --> 00:09:50.376
Air East 31, descend
and maintain flight level 310.

00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:52.461
Break Allegheny,
turn right 30 degrees.

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.992
Get on the horn to
the 45th Recon Wing...

00:09:55.092 --> 00:09:57.341
and see what they're
testing up there.

00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:01.521
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:03.222
Air East 31, roger.

00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:07.518
The traffic is luminous and
exhibiting non-ballistic motion.

00:10:07.618 --> 00:10:10.437
Roger. Continue descent
at your discretion.

00:10:10.537 --> 00:10:13.732
Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.

00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:16.902
The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.823
And right by us. Right now.
Now, that was really close.

00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:23.759
Air East 31 is out of 340...

00:10:23.968 --> 00:10:26.620
Ask if they want to report officially.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.165
TWA 517, do you want
to report a UFO?

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:31.265
Over.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.507
TWA 517, do you want
to report a UFO?

00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:39.607
Over.

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:43.654
Negative. We don't want to report.

00:10:43.862 --> 00:10:44.862
Air East 31,

00:10:44.962 --> 00:10:47.682
do you wish to
report a UFO? Over.

00:10:48.742 --> 00:10:51.979
Negative. We don't want
to report one either.

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.483
Air East 31, do you wish to
file a report of any kind? Over.

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.695
I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:01.797
Air East 31, me neither.

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:05.686
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

00:13:33.657 --> 00:13:36.217
What are you doing?
- I'm just...

00:13:40.414 --> 00:13:42.414
What?

00:13:51.592 --> 00:13:53.592
Barry?

00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:06.021
Honey?

00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:17.574
Honey?

00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:23.038
Barry.

00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:26.794
Barry.

00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:29.461
Barry.

00:14:42.685 --> 00:14:45.688
Dad, do my problems for me.

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:49.342
I don't have to do
your problems for...

00:14:49.442 --> 00:14:51.385
you. You do your
problems for you.

00:14:51.485 --> 00:14:55.472
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

00:14:55.572 --> 00:14:58.267
I don't understand these fractions.

00:14:58.367 --> 00:15:01.620
All right. What's one-third of 60?

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.523
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.

00:15:04.623 --> 00:15:06.233
All right, look.

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:08.333
Let's say...

00:15:09.003 --> 00:15:12.464
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:16.493
And one-third is across
this switch here.

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:19.847
All right? Okay?

00:15:20.014 --> 00:15:24.018
And now another train is coming.

00:15:26.145 --> 00:15:29.256
How far do you have to move
this boxcar off the track...

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:31.967
...so that the other train
doesn't smash it?

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:35.471
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:37.571
Brad, any answer.

00:15:39.783 --> 00:15:41.869
Remember last weekend...

00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:46.008
...you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.916
Honey?

00:15:51.962 --> 00:15:54.741
And you also
promised Goofy Golf.

00:15:54.841 --> 00:15:56.841
Oh, yeah.

00:16:00.638 --> 00:16:04.308
Roy, what is all this stuff
on my table?

00:16:04.808 --> 00:16:07.294
I thought I told you
this was for my stuff.

00:16:07.394 --> 00:16:09.463
I mean, you can have that table.

00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:11.257
I don't want this on my table.

00:16:11.357 --> 00:16:13.484
This can cause tetanus.

00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:16.470
What is this?.
- You know what's playing?

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.570
Pinocchio.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.515
The kids have never
seen Pinocchio.

00:16:19.615 --> 00:16:22.351
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.

00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:23.811
I don't believe this.

00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:25.648
Who wants to go see...

00:16:25.748 --> 00:16:28.548
some dumb cartoon
rated G for kids?

00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:30.791
How old are you?
- Eight.

00:16:30.876 --> 00:16:32.736
You wanna be 9?
- Yeah.

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:36.516
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.993
That's a wonderful way
to win over your children.

00:16:39.093 --> 00:16:43.205
I'm not serious. I'm just saying
that I grew up with Pinocchio.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:47.385
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.794
Okay.

00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:51.422
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

00:16:51.522 --> 00:16:55.359
Toby. You are close to death.
Come out here.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:02.774
Okay, now, I'll give
you your choice.

00:17:02.874 --> 00:17:05.269
I'm not gonna be
biased in any way.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.542
You can either play
Goofy Golf, which...

00:17:07.642 --> 00:17:09.648
means a lot of
waiting and pushing...

00:17:09.748 --> 00:17:12.148
...or you can see Pinocchio...

00:17:12.334 --> 00:17:14.678
...which is a lot of
furry animals and...

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:16.655
magic and a
wonderful time. Okay?

00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:18.616
Now, let's vote.
- Golf.

00:17:18.716 --> 00:17:20.492
All right, everybody to bed.

00:17:20.592 --> 00:17:23.213
No way. Dad said we could finish...

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.546
watching The Ten
Commandments.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:28.446
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

00:17:28.475 --> 00:17:29.145
I told them...

00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:31.045
they'd watch only
five commandments.

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:32.755
Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
- Hi, Earl.

00:17:32.855 --> 00:17:36.175
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.

00:17:36.275 --> 00:17:38.385
Roy can't drive at
night without me.

00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:40.804
We're experiencing
an overall outage.

00:17:40.904 --> 00:17:44.104
Wait, wait, wait, I
can't... Hey, honey.

00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:48.078
Jiminy Cricket.
It's Earl on the phone.

00:17:51.123 --> 00:17:52.650
Just a second.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.859
Hello.
- Neary.

00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:57.488
Get into your truck
and report to line N in Tolono.

00:17:57.588 --> 00:17:59.836
We're losing power
across the grid.

00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:01.659
Has the outage hit you yet?

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:06.263
Neary? Neary? Neary?

00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:16.104
Hey. Lights.

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:43.717
Barry.

00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:53.394
Barry.

00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:08.158
Help. I'm lost.

00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:14.023
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

00:19:14.123 --> 00:19:17.401
Cough up a Tolono
or an interstate, a Highway 90.

00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:20.279
A little familiar landmark
of some sort.

00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:23.449
Cornbread Road, south of 20.
- Cornbread?

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:25.326
Power must have been restored.

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:28.746
Couple hundred neighbours think
it's Saturday night.

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:30.080
Dispatch, this is 411.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.700
Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?

00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:39.006
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass.

00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:41.366
Can you tell me
where Cornbread is?

00:19:41.466 --> 00:19:43.466
Turkey.

00:20:10.304 --> 00:20:13.557
A-34... A-34... F-27.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.978
M-Mary-10 through
M-Mary-12. Okay.

00:20:18.228 --> 00:20:21.065
Ten-47.

00:20:24.818 --> 00:20:25.970
All right.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:31.030
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.701
M-Mary-10.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:09.196
Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...

00:21:40.644 --> 00:21:42.644
Oh, shit.

00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:37.286
Unit 211, I'm back up on the street.
What do you guys got out there?

00:23:37.386 --> 00:23:39.386
I don't believe this.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.570
My God. It's bigger than a house.

00:23:44.018 --> 00:23:46.178
This thing is lik e a barn.

00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:49.315
This is absolutely crazy.

00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.594
What is your location?

00:23:53.694 --> 00:23:58.654
Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.

00:25:04.056 --> 00:25:06.056
Barry.

00:25:06.976 --> 00:25:08.377
No.

00:25:08.477 --> 00:25:10.477
Watch out.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.903
Oh, my God. Lady. Lady.

00:25:18.112 --> 00:25:20.112
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:23.893
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.

00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:25.995
Hello?
- Oh, my God.

00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:29.540
Hello. Here.
- What's the matter with you?

00:25:30.457 --> 00:25:34.545
Barry, come back here.
Come on, now.

00:26:04.658 --> 00:26:06.658
Ice cream.

00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:28.221
This is nuts.

00:26:29.224 --> 00:26:31.224
No.

00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:13.266
Wait a minute.

00:27:13.686 --> 00:27:16.105
What are you guys doing? Hey.

00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:19.024
That's Ohio. That's a quarter.

00:27:23.946 --> 00:27:28.346
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road.

00:28:15.414 --> 00:28:17.414
Honey, wake up.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Ronnie, wake up.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.278
You're not gonna
believe what I saw.

00:28:21.378 --> 00:28:23.113
Don't. Not now.

00:28:23.213 --> 00:28:26.075
No, listen.
I never would have believed it.

00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:28.869
There was this...
In the cab there was this whole...

00:28:28.969 --> 00:28:32.969
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...

00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:34.917
Roy.

00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:36.877
Ike called you.

00:28:36.977 --> 00:28:38.796
And McGovern.

00:28:38.896 --> 00:28:41.799
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:43.342
I turned the radio off.

00:28:43.442 --> 00:28:45.719
Don't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.

00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.050
It woke Sylvia up
two times already.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.557
You'd better call them.

00:28:49.657 --> 00:28:51.363
You know those
pictures in National

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.018
Geographic, the aurora borealis?

00:28:53.118 --> 00:28:54.754
This is better than
that. This is really...

00:28:54.854 --> 00:28:55.854
Come on.

00:28:55.954 --> 00:28:58.023
Come on, Ronnie,
get up. Come on.

00:28:58.123 --> 00:29:00.401
What's wrong?
- Nothing. I don't know.

00:29:00.501 --> 00:29:02.862
Get up. I'm not kidding.
- Is it an accident?

00:29:02.962 --> 00:29:06.115
It's not an accident. You wanted
to get out of the house, right?

00:29:06.215 --> 00:29:07.950
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.553
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

00:29:11.762 --> 00:29:13.762
It's really important.

00:29:13.764 --> 00:29:16.458
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?

00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:18.502
What? Oh, the kids.
I'll get the kids.

00:29:18.602 --> 00:29:20.880
Sylvia, we're going
on an adventure.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.607
Toby. Brad. Come on. Get up.

00:29:23.816 --> 00:29:26.056
It's better than Goofy Golf.

00:29:29.738 --> 00:29:32.116
I'm going as fast as I can.

00:29:33.158 --> 00:29:35.158
Come on.

00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:39.415
All right, all right.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:41.400
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.108
There better be a good
reason for this...

00:29:44.208 --> 00:29:46.363
because it doesn't
make any sense.

00:29:46.463 --> 00:29:50.492
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

00:29:50.592 --> 00:29:53.595
Roy. Roy.

00:29:53.762 --> 00:29:56.562
Roy, you're sunburned.
Look at you.

00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:04.104
Honey, what is that?

00:30:08.944 --> 00:30:11.104
Roy, what did it look like?

00:30:11.989 --> 00:30:14.389
It was like an ice-cream cone.

00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.645
What flavour?

00:30:17.745 --> 00:30:19.745
Orange.

00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:22.691
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:25.152
It was more like a shell.
You know, like this:

00:30:25.252 --> 00:30:26.779
Like a taco?

00:30:26.879 --> 00:30:31.508
Was it like one of those Sara Lee
moon-shaped cookies?

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:34.303
Those crescent cookies?

00:30:42.936 --> 00:30:46.376
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

00:30:49.109 --> 00:30:52.116
I remember coming to
places like this...

00:30:52.216 --> 00:30:54.376
just to look at each other.

00:30:57.618 --> 00:30:59.618
Snuggle.

00:33:24.974 --> 00:33:28.727
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

00:33:29.478 --> 00:33:31.005
I don't believe it.

00:33:31.105 --> 00:33:32.256
It's the Cotopaxi.

00:33:32.356 --> 00:33:35.716
Why is it here?
- Beats the shit out of me.

00:34:10.102 --> 00:34:12.104
Is this the bathroom?

00:34:29.997 --> 00:34:32.139
Hey, this is not your
toy to play with...

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.526
every time I turn around.

00:34:33.626 --> 00:34:35.528
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.

00:34:35.628 --> 00:34:39.406
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

00:34:39.506 --> 00:34:41.951
I'm sorry, but you're
not to play with this.

00:34:42.051 --> 00:34:44.851
Get out while I
clean up your mess.

00:34:45.012 --> 00:34:47.012
Thank you very much.

00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:07.726
Roy, I found
this overnight-tanning stuff.

00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:11.897
I want you to spray it on half
your face, so it's all one colour.

00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:15.776
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?

00:35:15.876 --> 00:35:18.237
Then we'll tell everybody
you fell asleep...

00:35:18.337 --> 00:35:20.406
...under the sun lamp
on your right side.

00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:22.506
What for?

00:35:23.342 --> 00:35:25.870
Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.580
Are they for real?

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.916
That's what for.
No, they are not for real.

00:35:31.016 --> 00:35:33.460
Go outside and have
a hot dog, okay?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.546
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

00:35:35.646 --> 00:35:37.499
Roy, look, don't talk
about this until...

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.174
you know what you're
talking about.

00:35:39.274 --> 00:35:43.429
If I can't talk about it,
how will I know what's going on?

00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:46.407
What?
- Mom, I believe in them.

00:35:46.615 --> 00:35:49.994
I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.

00:35:50.244 --> 00:35:52.021
Dad says we do.

00:35:52.121 --> 00:35:54.121
No, he does not.

00:35:54.707 --> 00:35:57.042
Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.

00:35:57.209 --> 00:36:00.713
All I wanna do is know
what's going on.

00:36:00.963 --> 00:36:04.241
Nothing's going on.
It's just one of those things.

00:36:04.341 --> 00:36:06.501
Which things? Which things?

00:36:06.802 --> 00:36:09.622
I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is very important.

00:36:09.722 --> 00:36:12.666
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody.

00:36:12.766 --> 00:36:15.044
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

00:36:15.144 --> 00:36:18.904
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

00:36:19.815 --> 00:36:23.175
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:27.206
I'm going out there again tonight.

00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:32.244
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:35.539
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:39.527
No, you're not.

00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:41.111
Do they live on the moon?

00:36:41.211 --> 00:36:43.374
They got bases there so at night...

00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.574
they can come
through your window.

00:36:45.674 --> 00:36:48.761
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it.

00:36:48.969 --> 00:36:51.997
You came through my window.
- You hurt me.

00:36:52.097 --> 00:36:54.875
You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.

00:36:54.975 --> 00:36:57.695
He loves his work. Don't say that.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.339
What did he do?
He was with us all night.

00:37:00.439 --> 00:37:02.091
I won't have to go tonight.

00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:04.902
He is not like that at all.

00:37:05.486 --> 00:37:07.488
Stop yelling at me.

00:37:07.946 --> 00:37:10.057
Can't you tell him about this?

00:37:10.157 --> 00:37:11.767
Hello?

00:37:11.867 --> 00:37:13.644
I can't believe it.

00:37:13.744 --> 00:37:15.271
Roy...

00:37:15.371 --> 00:37:17.371
...you got fired.

00:37:17.998 --> 00:37:20.798
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

00:38:34.575 --> 00:38:37.295
Where were the
sounds coming from?

00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:05.693
Where did these
sounds come from?

00:39:05.793 --> 00:39:07.793
Tell us, please.

00:39:33.634 --> 00:39:36.434
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:39:40.474 --> 00:39:44.478
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

00:39:47.272 --> 00:39:49.049
I want to share with you now...

00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:52.509
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.864
We think it means something.

00:39:56.991 --> 00:39:59.827
We think it is important.

00:40:00.411 --> 00:40:03.502
To help you learn, I
am using the hand...

00:40:03.602 --> 00:40:06.002
sign created by Zoltán Kodály.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.755
Kodály developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

00:41:36.924 --> 00:41:38.924
Hello?

00:41:39.218 --> 00:41:40.369
Hi.

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:42.955
Hi, how are you?
You came here too?

00:41:43.055 --> 00:41:44.707
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

00:41:44.807 --> 00:41:47.209
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.

00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:50.312
Good night.
- What?

00:41:52.022 --> 00:41:54.233
Look at you.

00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:59.363
You got the same burn.

00:41:59.613 --> 00:42:03.642
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

00:42:03.742 --> 00:42:06.542
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

00:42:06.787 --> 00:42:08.981
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.691
I'll be right back.

00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:13.903
Raise your head a bit
and give me a smile. Come on.

00:42:14.003 --> 00:42:17.923
He's a little young for a record,
don't you think?

00:42:37.067 --> 00:42:39.067
Weird.

00:42:40.154 --> 00:42:45.274
I know this sounds crazy, but
ever since yesterday on the road...

00:42:45.492 --> 00:42:47.972
...l've been seeing this shape.

00:42:49.747 --> 00:42:52.791
In shaving cream and pillows...

00:43:05.179 --> 00:43:09.266
Damn it, I know this.
I know what this is.

00:43:14.772 --> 00:43:16.772
This means something.

00:43:22.988 --> 00:43:24.988
This is important.

00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:28.577
Here they come.
- Get the camera.

00:43:28.786 --> 00:43:32.164
Out of the northwest.
- Jimmy, come here.

00:43:46.095 --> 00:43:48.931
It's like Halloween for grownups.

00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:52.641
Trick or treat.

00:44:23.173 --> 00:44:25.173
Wait a minute.

00:45:17.561 --> 00:45:18.754
Here are the patterns.

00:45:18.854 --> 00:45:21.191
We received two
15-minute broadcasts.

00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:22.466
Non-random signals?

00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:25.091
104 rapid pulses.
After a five-second...

00:45:25.191 --> 00:45:26.428
interval, 40 pulses.

00:45:26.528 --> 00:45:29.728
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

00:45:30.783 --> 00:45:33.315
Silence, then a
new set of numbers.

00:45:33.415 --> 00:45:36.021
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.

00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:38.290
104 rapid pulses.
- Lord.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.620
Wait 60 seconds and the
whole doggone thing repeats.

00:45:42.878 --> 00:45:45.739
Where are the signals from?
- The neighbourhood.

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:47.950
Light-travel time,
roughly 7 seconds.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.327
Well within the plane
of the ecliptic.

00:45:50.427 --> 00:45:52.947
Are these non-random
signals here,

00:45:53.047 --> 00:45:55.416
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

00:45:55.516 --> 00:45:58.961
No. They should be. We've sent
this combination out for weeks.

00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:02.101
But all we're getting back
are numbers.

00:46:06.652 --> 00:46:10.598
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

00:46:10.698 --> 00:46:12.099
They don't mean a thing.

00:46:12.199 --> 00:46:14.351
There's so much we don't know.

00:46:14.451 --> 00:46:17.491
How about where the
signals originate?

00:46:20.082 --> 00:46:22.082
Excuse me.

00:46:23.752 --> 00:46:25.754
What letter is 104?

00:46:28.173 --> 00:46:30.173
Excuse me.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.806
Before I got paid to speak French...

00:46:38.934 --> 00:46:40.934
...I used to read maps.

00:46:42.688 --> 00:46:45.328
This first number is a longitude.

00:46:48.902 --> 00:46:52.072
I've got two sets of three numbers.

00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:55.242
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

00:46:55.451 --> 00:47:00.571
The first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

00:47:00.623 --> 00:47:05.110
It's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.696
These have to be
Earth coordinates.

00:47:07.796 --> 00:47:10.196
There's a globe in the office.

00:47:13.302 --> 00:47:14.745
This is what we need.

00:47:14.845 --> 00:47:17.665
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

00:47:17.765 --> 00:47:20.125
That's a $2500 globe.
What are you doing?

00:47:20.225 --> 00:47:24.385
It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.

00:47:38.285 --> 00:47:42.525
All right, everybody, quiet down.
Hold it down. Quiet.

00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:46.777
That's not right.

00:47:46.877 --> 00:47:49.213
The antenna. How dumb.

00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:51.282
Which way's it pointing?
- Northeast.

00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:53.382
That's Wyoming.

00:47:59.723 --> 00:48:02.334
We'll need a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

00:48:02.434 --> 00:48:04.420
I want it to the square yard.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.673
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

00:48:07.773 --> 00:48:09.858
We not only need...

00:49:59.426 --> 00:50:01.426
Toys.

00:50:02.179 --> 00:50:04.179
Toys.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.300
Oh, my God.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.916
You can come and play now.

00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:56.246
You can come and play now.

00:52:01.256 --> 00:52:03.926
Come in through the door.

00:52:05.803 --> 00:52:09.139
One, two, three...

00:52:17.898 --> 00:52:19.383
Oh, honey.

00:52:19.483 --> 00:52:21.610
Mom, look. The sun's here.

00:52:24.697 --> 00:52:26.824
Oh, honey.

00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:29.491
Oh, my God.

00:53:07.364 --> 00:53:09.364
Go away.

00:53:33.182 --> 00:53:35.182
Clean everything up.

00:53:50.866 --> 00:53:54.146
Mom, let me listen.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

00:54:10.636 --> 00:54:12.636
Mom, look.
- Oh, my God.

00:54:20.854 --> 00:54:23.273
Come in through the door.

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:49.341
Barry. Barry.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.310
Jillian. Jillian.

00:55:03.731 --> 00:55:05.090
May we have a statement?

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:08.219
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:10.639
We need it for the 6:00 news.

00:55:13.073 --> 00:55:14.433
They got him.

00:55:14.533 --> 00:55:15.684
What?

00:55:15.784 --> 00:55:18.521
Is it true you're leaving
to look for your son?

00:55:18.621 --> 00:55:23.421
Has there been a ransom note?
- Where will you start looking?

00:55:24.501 --> 00:55:26.501
His name is Barry.

00:55:27.212 --> 00:55:30.252
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:34.639
Are you involved in any
kind of parapsychologies?

00:55:35.346 --> 00:55:37.986
Turn around, please. Turn around.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.160
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?

00:55:46.857 --> 00:55:49.985
Folks, you can go
in now. Room 3655.

00:55:50.444 --> 00:55:53.889
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

00:55:53.989 --> 00:55:55.989
That's the one I saw.

00:55:58.035 --> 00:56:01.795
I swear that's the same one.
It's the one I saw.

00:56:02.623 --> 00:56:05.317
It's made of pewter,
made in Japan...

00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:09.497
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

00:56:10.255 --> 00:56:14.660
I wanted to point out that we're
not all 'polished brass' about this.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.680
And also point out that last year...

00:56:17.888 --> 00:56:21.000
...Americans shot more than seven
billion photographs...

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.572
...at a record of $6.6 billion...

00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:26.217
for film equipment
and processing.

00:56:26.317 --> 00:56:28.299
Now, with all those
shutters clicking...

00:56:28.399 --> 00:56:31.302
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

00:56:31.402 --> 00:56:34.930
I've been in the news
business for a long time.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:39.059
We never took a picture
of a plane crash as it happened...

00:56:39.159 --> 00:56:43.639
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

00:56:50.879 --> 00:56:54.533
There are lots of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

00:56:54.633 --> 00:56:56.452
Mental telepathy...

00:56:56.552 --> 00:56:58.329
...time travel...

00:56:58.429 --> 00:57:00.429
...immortality...

00:57:00.723 --> 00:57:02.723
...even Santa Claus.

00:57:03.225 --> 00:57:07.504
I know it's no fun to go home and
say, 'Guess what happened today?

00:57:07.604 --> 00:57:11.467
I was in the shopping centre,
and there was this bright light...

00:57:11.567 --> 00:57:13.777
...and I rushed outside...

00:57:13.986 --> 00:57:16.226
...and it was an aeroplane.'

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.560
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.

00:57:20.534 --> 00:57:21.977
I sure wish I had.

00:57:22.077 --> 00:57:24.146
For 15 years I've been looking...

00:57:24.246 --> 00:57:27.650
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.276
I've never found any.

00:57:29.376 --> 00:57:32.613
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.

00:57:32.713 --> 00:57:34.114
Why don't you admit...

00:57:34.214 --> 00:57:38.077
...that the Air Force is conducting
tests in the Foothills area?

00:57:38.177 --> 00:57:41.057
It would be easy to say yes to that.

00:57:41.555 --> 00:57:45.709
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:47.889
I don't know what you saw.

00:57:48.062 --> 00:57:50.548
You can't fool us by
agreeing with us.

00:57:50.648 --> 00:57:52.341
No, come on.

00:57:52.441 --> 00:57:54.441
I saw Bigfoot once.

00:57:59.198 --> 00:58:03.369
1951. Back in Sequoia
National Park.

00:58:03.577 --> 00:58:07.831
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.

00:58:11.752 --> 00:58:16.072
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

00:58:20.177 --> 00:58:24.017
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

00:58:24.139 --> 00:58:26.876
I was sitting on the porch,
looking through the screen.

00:58:26.976 --> 00:58:29.461
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:32.201
It turned red and blue and green.

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:39.087
UFOs do not represent a direct...

00:58:39.187 --> 00:58:42.147
physical threat to
national security.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.780
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

00:59:24.992 --> 00:59:27.269
Let's get in touch with
the forest service...

00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:31.357
...or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

00:59:31.457 --> 00:59:36.497
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

00:59:41.675 --> 00:59:44.315
If this mission fully develops...

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.322
...I get white knuckles
thinking about...

00:59:48.422 --> 00:59:51.168
what might be ahead
for those folks.

00:59:51.268 --> 00:59:53.212
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.

00:59:53.312 --> 00:59:57.392
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

00:59:57.524 --> 01:00:00.348
And transportation
will be provided...

01:00:00.448 --> 01:00:02.448
on the other end.

01:00:03.572 --> 01:00:06.267
I like the flash-flood idea.
- Where do you get the water?

01:00:06.367 --> 01:00:08.102
We've had about two
inches of rain...

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:10.839
We'll tell them one
of the reservoirs...

01:00:10.939 --> 01:00:11.897
is gonna burst.

01:00:11.997 --> 01:00:14.733
Besides, there's not enough water
in those reservoirs.

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:18.320
Wait. Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.697
Disease.

01:00:19.797 --> 01:00:22.616
Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:23.868
A plague epidemic.

01:00:23.968 --> 01:00:26.288
Nobody will believe a plague.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.880
Anthrax.
- Ranching country.

01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:31.333
There are a lot of
sheep in the hills.

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:32.793
Good, I like that.

01:00:32.893 --> 01:00:34.063
It'll create a panic.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:36.088
But it may not evacuate everybody.

01:00:36.188 --> 01:00:40.028
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:45.431
I need something so scary
it'll clear 300 square miles...

01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:48.409
...of every living Christian soul.

01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:21.648
Help yourself.

01:01:24.403 --> 01:01:28.907
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

01:01:29.116 --> 01:01:31.116
It's okay.

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:19.329
Well, I guess you've noticed...

01:03:19.601 --> 01:03:24.106
...something is a little strange
with Dad.

01:03:27.318 --> 01:03:29.318
It's okay, though.

01:03:31.363 --> 01:03:33.363
I'm still Dad.

01:03:38.078 --> 01:03:42.124
I can't describe it,
what I'm feeling...

01:03:42.374 --> 01:03:44.710
...and what I'm thinking.

01:03:47.338 --> 01:03:49.548
This means something.

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.093
This is important.

01:04:04.229 --> 01:04:06.229
That's not right.

01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:11.818
It's not right.

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:15.447
That's not right.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560
What is it?

01:04:46.897 --> 01:04:49.233
What is it?.

01:04:56.615 --> 01:04:58.615
It's not fair.

01:05:03.872 --> 01:05:05.872
Tell me.

01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:34.236
Roy? Roy.

01:05:35.154 --> 01:05:37.154
Open the door, please.

01:05:38.032 --> 01:05:42.244
Please. Roy. Roy.

01:05:42.411 --> 01:05:44.230
Open this door.

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.330
Open this door.

01:05:51.879 --> 01:05:53.879
All right.

01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:18.133
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

01:06:23.619 --> 01:06:28.248
Look, Roy. What it is,
is family therapy.

01:06:28.457 --> 01:06:31.168
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

01:06:31.418 --> 01:06:35.489
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:40.389
It's waterproof. It still works.
- Roy. Promise me you'll go.

01:06:40.844 --> 01:06:43.889
You crybaby. You crybaby.

01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:46.125
You crybaby.
- Get out of here.

01:06:46.225 --> 01:06:47.501
Get out.

01:06:47.601 --> 01:06:50.020
Come on, you guys. Come on.

01:06:50.187 --> 01:06:52.187
You crybaby.

01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:53.883
Be quiet.
- Stop it.

01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:55.718
I don't understand it.

01:06:55.818 --> 01:06:58.279
Neither do I.
- Get out.

01:06:58.529 --> 01:07:01.448
Go to your room
and close the door.

01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.644
Ronnie?
- Yes.

01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:09.915
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.

01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:11.207
All this bullshit.

01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:13.319
It's turning this
house upside down.

01:07:13.419 --> 01:07:15.988
Ronnie, just...
- I just hate you. That's why.

01:07:16.088 --> 01:07:17.865
No.
- Ronnie. Ronnie.

01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:21.452
Hold me. Put your arms
around me. It'll really help me.

01:07:21.552 --> 01:07:22.828
It'll really help me.

01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:26.123
Listen. Listen.
Don't you see what's happening?

01:07:26.223 --> 01:07:28.334
None of our friends
call us anymore.

01:07:28.434 --> 01:07:30.753
You're out of work. You don't care.

01:07:30.853 --> 01:07:33.813
You're wrecking us.
You're ruining us.

01:07:33.939 --> 01:07:36.442
Ronnie, just hold on.
- No. No.

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:38.650
Hold on.
- No.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.820
Ronnie.

01:07:42.323 --> 01:07:44.323
Ronnie?

01:07:45.492 --> 01:07:48.537
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

01:08:23.864 --> 01:08:27.224
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:33.957
Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.

01:08:34.458 --> 01:08:36.458
Thank you.

01:08:43.092 --> 01:08:45.492
Well, I guess he's had enough.

01:08:47.513 --> 01:08:49.848
Are you going to yell at me?

01:09:05.531 --> 01:09:08.450
Ronnie? Everything's fine.

01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:21.069
All this stuff is coming down.

01:09:25.718 --> 01:09:28.470
It's all gonna be like it was.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:41.734
That's the last straw.
Now I use my secret weapon.

01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:12.831
Roy?

01:10:12.931 --> 01:10:16.644
Roy, I'm sorry about
last night. Roy.

01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:21.941
Roy, what are you doing?

01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:24.942
Jesus.

01:10:33.786 --> 01:10:35.866
The plants are fine there.

01:10:36.497 --> 01:10:38.274
Can you hear me?

01:10:38.374 --> 01:10:39.650
Wait.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.752
Wait. What are you doing?

01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:43.237
You're gonna love it.

01:10:43.337 --> 01:10:45.865
What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.

01:10:45.965 --> 01:10:48.676
Roy, what are you doing?

01:10:54.139 --> 01:10:56.139
Oh, Roy.

01:10:56.642 --> 01:10:58.642
My God.

01:10:59.353 --> 01:11:01.353
Come on, men.

01:11:02.314 --> 01:11:06.527
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:12.114
Stop it.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.560
Stop. Stop it.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.660
Honey.

01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:21.104
If I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:25.863
What are you doing?

01:11:25.963 --> 01:11:27.740
I got it.
- What are you doing?

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.452
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

01:11:31.552 --> 01:11:34.093
You ever look at
something crazy, and...

01:11:34.193 --> 01:11:36.540
then see it another
way and it's not?

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.791
No, I haven't.

01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:40.044
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:42.588
I don't know what you're doing.
- Close your eyes.

01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:45.032
Close your eyes and
hold your breath,

01:11:45.132 --> 01:11:47.218
everything will be really pretty.

01:11:47.318 --> 01:11:48.469
You're scaring us now.

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:51.805
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.

01:11:51.905 --> 01:11:53.766
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:11:53.866 --> 01:11:56.143
I haven't felt this good in years.

01:11:56.243 --> 01:11:59.523
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:05.630
Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?

01:12:05.919 --> 01:12:07.919
Right.

01:12:46.168 --> 01:12:48.168
Like this?

01:12:50.339 --> 01:12:52.339
Chicken wire.

01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:04.336
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law.

01:13:04.436 --> 01:13:06.213
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:07.464
I'll pay you for this.

01:13:07.564 --> 01:13:08.716
Take it. Take it.

01:13:08.816 --> 01:13:10.816
I'm perfectly fine.

01:13:10.859 --> 01:13:13.053
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.

01:13:13.153 --> 01:13:16.140
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.726
Toby. Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:13:18.826 --> 01:13:20.686
Come on, right now.
We're going.

01:13:20.786 --> 01:13:24.866
I want to stay here.
- Let go of the fence. Come on.

01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:44.351
Stay. Stay.

01:13:48.314 --> 01:13:50.874
Where we going?
- Where we going?

01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:52.718
Where are we going?
- Get in the car.

01:13:52.818 --> 01:13:56.096
Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.

01:13:56.196 --> 01:13:57.765
Get in there, Toby.

01:13:57.865 --> 01:13:59.865
Quickly.

01:14:02.036 --> 01:14:04.605
Dad needs some more help.
- Lock the doors.

01:14:04.705 --> 01:14:06.148
Dad needs some more help.

01:14:06.248 --> 01:14:09.860
Quiet. Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.463
Dad needs some more help.

01:14:12.713 --> 01:14:14.406
Honey, where you going?

01:14:14.506 --> 01:14:16.666
What?
- Where are you going?

01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:19.739
Taking the kids to my sister's.

01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:24.056
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.

01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:25.793
What?

01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:27.893
You said what?

01:14:32.274 --> 01:14:34.093
Ronnie, wait.

01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:36.195
Ronnie, hold it.

01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:40.016
Would you hold it one minute?

01:15:06.392 --> 01:15:08.392
Morning.

01:15:46.974 --> 01:15:50.144
What is wrong with me today?

01:15:56.233 --> 01:15:57.760
Who is it, please?

01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.690
It's the mailman.
There's a package...

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.790
for Julie Anderson.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.245
You can just leave it at the door.

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:14.251
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.460
And besides...

01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:20.034
...you and I have to have
a little talk...

01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:22.215
...about Kim.

01:16:41.362 --> 01:16:44.242
Lik e sands through
the hourglass...

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:47.451
...so are the Days of Our Lives.

01:17:13.185 --> 01:17:15.514
Good evening. At the
top of the news...

01:17:15.614 --> 01:17:17.089
tonight, a rail disaster.

01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:19.175
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...

01:17:19.275 --> 01:17:22.845
...a trainload of dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...

01:17:22.945 --> 01:17:25.681
...and forced the widest
area evacuation...

01:17:25.781 --> 01:17:29.143
...in the history of these
controversial Army rail shipments.

01:17:29.243 --> 01:17:32.579
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.667
I can do other things.

01:17:37.376 --> 01:17:39.628
I'm trying to be.

01:17:40.963 --> 01:17:42.114
Yes, I am.

01:17:42.214 --> 01:17:45.492
The Army and National Guard are
supervising the evacuation.

01:17:45.592 --> 01:17:50.055
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

01:17:50.264 --> 01:17:51.999
It was a joke.

01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:55.219
The danger will be over
within 72 hours.

01:17:55.519 --> 01:17:58.314
Ronnie, anything you want.

01:17:58.647 --> 01:18:01.275
Anything you want, I'll do.

01:18:04.236 --> 01:18:06.236
For how long?

01:18:11.744 --> 01:18:13.744
All of you?

01:18:14.705 --> 01:18:19.251
No. Ronnie, I wanna talk
about this in person.

01:18:20.336 --> 01:18:24.816
This is not... We can't talk
about this on the telephone.

01:18:25.299 --> 01:18:27.993
Ronnie. Don't hang up.
Just don't...

01:18:28.093 --> 01:18:30.748
meat should remain unaffected.

01:18:30.848 --> 01:18:34.224
This means order your
steak well-done.

01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:37.670
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was
the first national monument...

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.674
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

01:18:41.774 --> 01:18:45.386
Thousands of civilian refugees
are fleeing the area...

01:18:45.486 --> 01:18:49.056
...spurred by rumours that the
overturned tank er cars...

01:18:49.156 --> 01:18:51.548
...at Walkashi Needles
Junction were...

01:18:51.648 --> 01:18:53.727
filled to capacity with nerve gas.

01:18:53.827 --> 01:18:55.604
In a few minutes,
we're going to be...

01:18:55.704 --> 01:18:59.249
boasts 400, 000 vacationers.

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:02.236
Fortunately, during this mishap
there have been no fatalities.

01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:04.896
Evacuate this area,
which soon...

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:08.951
...will become the 'hot zone,'
depending on the prevailing winds.

01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:12.955
This is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.

01:19:13.055 --> 01:19:15.833
Due to a strong prevailing
north-south wind.

01:19:15.933 --> 01:19:18.836
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...

01:19:18.936 --> 01:19:22.590
...are making every effort to
contain the leaking toxins...

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.926
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.

01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:29.555
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.

01:19:29.655 --> 01:19:32.695
Everyone, please,
stay out of the area.

01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:35.019
And thousands of others
are homeless.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:39.690
U.S. Army Materiel Command has
issued these new area restrictions:

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:41.471
All roadways north
of Crowheart on

01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:42.234
Interstate 25.

01:19:42.334 --> 01:19:43.444
Shit.

01:19:43.544 --> 01:19:46.864
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.

01:19:46.964 --> 01:19:49.992
All multilane undivided
full-traffic interchange...

01:19:50.092 --> 01:19:54.652
...railroad, local and historic
stage roads south of Cody.

01:20:04.356 --> 01:20:08.596
Why aren't there fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

01:20:08.819 --> 01:20:10.819
Yo.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.350
Holy mother of...
- You're going the wrong way.

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:18.996
Yo. Turn back around.
Back this way.

01:20:19.622 --> 01:20:21.357
What's the matter with you?

01:20:21.457 --> 01:20:23.150
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.610
It's just a rental, officer.
Just a rental.

01:20:26.879 --> 01:20:28.364
My fault. My fault.

01:20:28.464 --> 01:20:30.908
Starting with the letter 'F,'
as in 'Frank'...

01:20:31.008 --> 01:20:33.285
...to the letter 'J' as in 'Jack'...

01:20:33.385 --> 01:20:36.480
...please find your
way to the loading...

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.140
platform for immediate boarding.

01:20:41.393 --> 01:20:43.838
You'll be real disappointed
and sorry...

01:20:43.938 --> 01:20:46.348
...if you don't have
an early-warning...

01:20:46.448 --> 01:20:48.551
system, such as a
bird, a gas mask.

01:20:48.651 --> 01:20:50.886
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

01:20:50.986 --> 01:20:54.666
And any of you folks are
worth more than a dog.

01:20:56.408 --> 01:21:00.037
Roy? Roy.

01:21:01.664 --> 01:21:03.666
Roy.

01:21:16.845 --> 01:21:18.845
Roy?

01:21:21.225 --> 01:21:23.225
Roy?

01:21:25.354 --> 01:21:27.354
Roy.

01:21:28.107 --> 01:21:30.107
Roy.

01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:34.611
Roy.

01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:42.771
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricade.

01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:45.082
There's no way out.

01:22:08.564 --> 01:22:09.715
What are we doing?

01:22:09.815 --> 01:22:11.714
Only way to get back
is cross-country.

01:22:11.814 --> 01:22:13.302
We'll break through the fence.

01:22:13.402 --> 01:22:16.522
Let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.

01:22:39.345 --> 01:22:41.789
The police dragged
the river for him.

01:22:41.889 --> 01:22:44.959
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.

01:22:45.059 --> 01:22:48.097
Then they went around
to every house...

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:50.197
within five miles...

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:54.818
...looking inside
back-yard refrigerators.

01:22:58.864 --> 01:23:01.778
They asked if I'd
seen any strangers...

01:23:01.878 --> 01:23:03.878
in the neighbourhood.

01:24:10.394 --> 01:24:12.605
I don't believe it's real.

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:16.812
I don't believe it's real.

01:24:18.027 --> 01:24:20.027
It's real.

01:24:26.076 --> 01:24:28.836
Let's get down there.
Get some gas...

01:24:28.936 --> 01:24:30.936
and get down in there.

01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:34.541
What are those?

01:24:58.025 --> 01:25:02.196
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:51.998
What do you want?
Get your hands off.

01:25:53.706 --> 01:25:56.426
How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

01:25:56.834 --> 01:26:00.008
According to my birds,
the only bad air...

01:26:00.108 --> 01:26:02.668
is from you guys farting around.

01:26:11.307 --> 01:26:13.334
Move them out.
- What's happening?

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.794
What? Where are we going?
- Go to the van.

01:26:15.894 --> 01:26:17.379
Where are you taking her?

01:26:17.479 --> 01:26:19.632
Hold it. Why can't we go together?

01:26:19.732 --> 01:26:21.175
Watch your step.

01:26:21.275 --> 01:26:23.275
Roy.

01:26:39.084 --> 01:26:42.154
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

01:26:42.254 --> 01:26:44.573
Hello.
- We need answers from you...

01:26:44.673 --> 01:26:46.909
...that are honest, direct
and to the point.

01:26:47.009 --> 01:26:49.009
Where is Jillian?

01:26:50.429 --> 01:26:54.500
Do you realise the danger you
and your friend have risked?

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.003
In coming here, you've
exposed yourself to toxic gas.

01:26:58.103 --> 01:26:59.797
Well, I'm alive.

01:26:59.897 --> 01:27:01.897
We're talking.

01:27:02.274 --> 01:27:04.318
This is true, Mr. Neary.

01:27:05.235 --> 01:27:09.875
But if the wind blew from
the south instead of the north...

01:27:10.032 --> 01:27:12.351
...this conversation would not be
taking place.

01:27:12.451 --> 01:27:15.251
There's nothing wrong with the air.

01:27:15.829 --> 01:27:17.565
What makes you say that?

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:20.359
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:22.859
Go outside and make me a liar.

01:27:26.882 --> 01:27:29.410
I wanna talk to the man in charge.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:32.162
Mr. Lacombe is the
highest authority.

01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:34.342
He isn't even an American.

01:27:36.475 --> 01:27:39.755
Mr. Neary, are you an artist
or a painter?

01:27:40.604 --> 01:27:42.604
No.

01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:47.264
Have you been hearing
a persistent...

01:27:47.364 --> 01:27:48.470
ringing in your ears?

01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:50.514
Almost an agreeable ringing?

01:27:50.614 --> 01:27:52.614
No.

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:55.315
Having headaches, migraines?

01:27:55.744 --> 01:27:57.744
Yeah.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.274
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

01:28:00.374 --> 01:28:02.374
Yeah.

01:28:02.626 --> 01:28:05.838
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

01:28:07.923 --> 01:28:10.284
And burning on your face
and on your body?

01:28:10.384 --> 01:28:13.120
Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:17.620
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?

01:28:22.104 --> 01:28:25.384
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

01:28:26.358 --> 01:28:29.478
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

01:28:30.112 --> 01:28:33.712
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

01:28:36.118 --> 01:28:38.245
Who are you people?

01:28:44.793 --> 01:28:49.033
These people strangers to you?
- Yeah. Except for her.

01:28:50.966 --> 01:28:54.486
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

01:28:54.928 --> 01:28:56.928
Yeah, you might say that.

01:28:57.306 --> 01:29:00.826
But what did you expect to find?
- An answer.

01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:04.186
That's not crazy, is it?

01:29:20.371 --> 01:29:23.374
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.624
Is that it?

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:28.353
Is that all you're gonna ask me?

01:29:29.129 --> 01:29:31.740
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.365
I wanna speak to
someone in charge.

01:29:34.465 --> 01:29:36.328
I wanna lodge a complaint.

01:29:36.428 --> 01:29:38.831
You have no right
to make people crazy.

01:29:38.931 --> 01:29:43.460
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.639
If this is just nerve
gas, how come I...

01:29:45.739 --> 01:29:47.339
know everything in such detail?

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:49.679
I've never been here before.

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.150
How come I know so much?

01:29:52.361 --> 01:29:54.388
What the hell is going on
around here?.

01:29:54.488 --> 01:29:56.808
Who the hell are you people?.

01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:23.475
Is that it?. Answer me.

01:30:24.184 --> 01:30:28.664
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home.

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:52.296
Five minutes. Five.

01:30:52.963 --> 01:30:56.163
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

01:31:29.124 --> 01:31:32.570
You brought 12 people to
the decontamination camp...

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:37.199
...instead of the evacuation centre
where they belong. Why?

01:31:37.299 --> 01:31:41.459
Because this means something.
- This means something.

01:31:42.012 --> 01:31:46.172
These people have come from
all over their country...

01:31:47.017 --> 01:31:50.546
...to a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

01:31:50.646 --> 01:31:51.922
Why?

01:31:52.022 --> 01:31:53.932
Because somebody
could be trying...

01:31:54.032 --> 01:31:55.885
to subvert this whole operation...

01:31:55.985 --> 01:32:00.139
...by sending in fanatics, cultists
and Christ knows what all.

01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:02.239
Yes.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:04.868
Thank you very much.

01:32:07.037 --> 01:32:09.757
This is a small group of people...

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:14.211
...who have shared
a vision in common.

01:32:14.837 --> 01:32:16.837
Look.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:22.369
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

01:32:22.469 --> 01:32:24.549
Even they do not know why.

01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:45.115
Jillian.

01:32:45.951 --> 01:32:48.229
Jillian.
- Don't. You'll be poisoned.

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:51.690
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:56.362
The Army's getting us out because
they don't want any witnesses.

01:32:56.462 --> 01:32:59.949
If the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:01.606
We wanted to see the mountain.

01:33:01.706 --> 01:33:03.744
It was a coincidence
when I painted it.

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.538
You can take it off.

01:33:05.638 --> 01:33:08.998
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

01:33:09.391 --> 01:33:12.155
Listen. How many of
you people are...

01:33:12.255 --> 01:33:14.255
for getting out of here?

01:33:18.734 --> 01:33:21.644
I don't know what's
happening either.

01:33:21.744 --> 01:33:24.304
I must find out what's going on.

01:33:26.992 --> 01:33:29.422
For every one of these anxious,

01:33:29.522 --> 01:33:32.402
anguished people
who've come here...

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:37.131
...there must be
hundreds more touched...

01:33:37.231 --> 01:33:39.864
by the vision who
never made it here.

01:33:39.964 --> 01:33:43.644
Simply because they never watch
the television.

01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:46.528
Or perhaps they watched
it, but never...

01:33:46.628 --> 01:33:47.997
made the psychic connection.

01:33:48.097 --> 01:33:51.892
It's a coincidence.
It's not scientific.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:56.422
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

01:33:56.522 --> 01:33:59.066
...it is an event sociological.

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:20.129
Hey. Wait a minute.

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:38.297
My name's Neary.
- Larry Butler.

01:34:38.397 --> 01:34:40.216
How are you?
- Okay. You?

01:34:40.316 --> 01:34:42.316
Fine, fine.
- That's good.

01:34:42.735 --> 01:34:45.001
Everybody keep their
masks on until...

01:34:45.101 --> 01:34:47.306
you're out of here
and out of danger.

01:34:47.406 --> 01:34:52.206
Listen, we wanna get out of here.
What's the matter with you?

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:10.179
Major Walsh, Major Walsh.
- Yes, sir.

01:35:10.346 --> 01:35:13.082
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

01:35:13.182 --> 01:35:16.062
Major, I want you to use infrared...

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.796
...and get me a photo analysis of
the northern face.

01:35:18.896 --> 01:35:21.090
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:23.233
Major Walsh, listen.

01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:25.265
I don't lik e to do this. We're in...

01:35:25.365 --> 01:35:27.137
enough trouble with
these cattlemen.

01:35:27.237 --> 01:35:31.267
If you can't get these folks
out of the area by 2000 hours...

01:35:31.367 --> 01:35:33.661
...start dusting with EZ-4.

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.688
What's EZ-4?

01:35:35.788 --> 01:35:39.275
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:40.943
Comes out of Riot Control.

01:35:41.043 --> 01:35:42.950
They'll sleep for six hours and...

01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:45.072
wake up with a
headache, that's all.

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:49.034
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people.

01:35:49.134 --> 01:35:51.220
They were invited.

01:35:57.268 --> 01:35:59.668
They belong here more than we.

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:09.138
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

01:36:09.238 --> 01:36:12.725
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.

01:36:12.825 --> 01:36:14.825
Here come three more.

01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:19.440
The authority in this park...

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.319
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

01:36:23.419 --> 01:36:26.071
There's a ravine
leading straight up.

01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:29.091
It's an easier climb.
- It's no good.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.037
When you get to the top, it's
a 300-foot drop down. Get down.

01:36:33.137 --> 01:36:36.332
What do you think is
down on the other side?

01:36:36.432 --> 01:36:38.362
There's a box canyon
on the other side...

01:36:38.462 --> 01:36:39.668
with ravines and trails...

01:36:39.768 --> 01:36:42.087
...if you take this incline
to the right.

01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:45.090
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.

01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:47.121
There was no canyon
in my doodles.

01:36:47.221 --> 01:36:48.219
Next time, sculpt.

01:36:48.319 --> 01:36:51.347
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.

01:36:51.447 --> 01:36:53.447
Come on, let's go.

01:36:58.162 --> 01:37:00.748
The authority in this park...

01:37:00.956 --> 01:37:05.276
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

01:37:05.461 --> 01:37:10.007
You are entering
a military reservation...

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.926
...and subject to military law.

01:37:13.135 --> 01:37:15.135
Call the bastard.

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.751
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

01:37:20.851 --> 01:37:22.127
Go ahead.

01:37:22.227 --> 01:37:24.672
Nothing to report at midstation.

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.800
Up ahead there's thousands
of places to hide.

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:32.054
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

01:37:32.154 --> 01:37:33.836
Get everybody off
the northern face,

01:37:33.936 --> 01:37:35.474
call the dark side of the moon...

01:37:35.574 --> 01:37:38.294
...and tell them we're gonna dust.

01:38:04.019 --> 01:38:06.019
Get down.

01:38:06.397 --> 01:38:09.341
You are entering a military
reservation...

01:38:09.441 --> 01:38:13.028
...and subject to military law.

01:38:42.641 --> 01:38:45.561
Larry. Larry, come on.

01:39:03.078 --> 01:39:06.248
Larry. Don't let them see you.
Get down.

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:45.996
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles.

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.920
Larry?
- Don't stop.

01:39:53.504 --> 01:39:56.224
Don't look back.
Come on, come on.

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.113
Roy.

01:40:26.829 --> 01:40:29.869
Hurry. We're only 10 feet
from the top.

01:40:29.873 --> 01:40:34.193
Just a few more feet. We can
slide down the other side.

01:40:40.217 --> 01:40:42.720
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

01:40:42.886 --> 01:40:44.886
Don't come down.

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.790
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:49.084
Don't worry. We'll make it.
- Roy.

01:40:49.184 --> 01:40:51.462
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move your ass.

01:40:51.562 --> 01:40:53.562
Come on.

01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:01.363
Roy, come on. Come on.
Please, come on.

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.489
Hurry.

01:41:05.868 --> 01:41:07.868
Hold it.

01:41:11.123 --> 01:41:13.123
Jump. Jump.

01:41:25.304 --> 01:41:28.349
Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.

01:41:29.058 --> 01:41:31.058
Good.

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:33.879
Is it on?
Check the speak er system here.

01:41:33.979 --> 01:41:36.148
I want this up all the way.

01:41:39.151 --> 01:41:41.387
Are you reading me on this one?

01:41:41.487 --> 01:41:43.487
How about here?

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:49.286
Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:52.064
Testing. Testing.

01:41:52.164 --> 01:41:55.292
One, two, three, testing.

01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:06.428
Gentlemen, ladies.
Tak e your positions, please.

01:42:07.638 --> 01:42:09.638
This is not a drill.

01:42:09.807 --> 01:42:13.310
I repeat, this is not a drill.

01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:15.943
Could we have the lights...

01:42:16.043 --> 01:42:18.299
in the arena down
60 percent, please?

01:42:18.399 --> 01:42:20.399
60 percent.

01:42:24.405 --> 01:42:29.445
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:39.442
Okay, watch the skies, please.

01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:42.762
We now show uncorrelated targets...

01:42:42.862 --> 01:42:45.822
approaching from
the north-northwest.

01:43:35.017 --> 01:43:38.457
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

01:43:47.738 --> 01:43:49.738
You see that?

01:43:51.367 --> 01:43:53.185
Yes.

01:43:53.285 --> 01:43:55.285
Good.

01:44:42.751 --> 01:44:47.256
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...

01:44:47.464 --> 01:44:51.302
...please evacuate the centre
approach mark er.

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:56.348
Audio analysis personnel,
behind the double yellow line.

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:05.036
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

01:45:05.524 --> 01:45:07.524
Auto ready?

01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:10.513
Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling.

01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:12.615
ARP and interlock now.

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.659
Speed set at seven and a half.

01:45:15.868 --> 01:45:19.121
All positive functions, standing by.

01:45:43.562 --> 01:45:45.047
Go ahead.

01:45:45.147 --> 01:45:47.147
Sunset.
- Go.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:50.069
Okay. Start with the tone.

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:59.117
Tang.
- Go.

01:45:59.328 --> 01:46:01.328
Up a full tone.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:06.333
Down a major third.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.460
Now drop an octave.

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:14.869
Cool blue.
- Go.

01:46:14.969 --> 01:46:16.971
Up a perfect fifth.

01:46:19.556 --> 01:46:21.556
Nothing. Nothing at all.

01:46:26.397 --> 01:46:27.965
Give me a tone.

01:46:28.065 --> 01:46:30.384
'Re' to the second.
- Up a full tone.

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:32.469
'Mi' to the third.
- Down a major third.

01:46:32.569 --> 01:46:34.763
'Do' to the first.
- Drop an octave.

01:46:34.863 --> 01:46:36.682
'Do' up a perfect fifth.

01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:38.782
'Sol' to the fifth.

01:46:54.591 --> 01:46:56.591
I know that.

01:46:58.637 --> 01:47:00.637
Faster.

01:47:15.613 --> 01:47:17.613
Kick that mule.

01:47:20.993 --> 01:47:22.993
Let's go.

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:06.021
I'm very happy tonight.

01:48:06.121 --> 01:48:08.361
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:11.794
Not a Merle Haggard,
but it was great.

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:33.438
Mr. Lacombe?

01:48:39.405 --> 01:48:42.116
What is it? What's happening?

01:49:37.713 --> 01:49:40.299
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:49:41.926 --> 01:49:43.926
Keep down.

01:49:49.224 --> 01:49:51.864
They're talking way over my head.

01:51:00.379 --> 01:51:02.379
Shit.
- Duck, duck.

01:51:38.417 --> 01:51:39.818
Photo one.

01:51:39.918 --> 01:51:43.297
Fantastic. Keep
those reloads coming.

01:51:43.505 --> 01:51:45.505
Fantastic.

01:51:51.722 --> 01:51:53.958
You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.

01:51:54.058 --> 01:51:57.144
We can't stay here.
- I can.

01:51:58.103 --> 01:52:01.690
Why?
- Because Barry's not here.

01:52:02.608 --> 01:52:04.610
I'm just not ready.

01:52:08.447 --> 01:52:10.724
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.

01:52:10.824 --> 01:52:12.824
I know.

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:50.030
This is data control
to all personnel.

01:52:50.447 --> 01:52:53.659
We monitor no biologic hazards.

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:56.203
Range safety clear.

01:54:03.729 --> 01:54:06.482
Oh, my God.

01:54:59.994 --> 01:55:02.204
Oh, my God.

01:55:26.186 --> 01:55:28.186
Holy shit.

01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:21.911
There is a safety-hazard zone...

01:57:22.011 --> 01:57:25.889
...extending 25
metres from the ship.

01:57:26.307 --> 01:57:31.145
Special teams are exempt and
should be aware of low gravity.

01:57:31.395 --> 01:57:35.816
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:42.110
All departments at operational
during this phase...

01:57:42.197 --> 01:57:44.437
...signify by beeping twice.

01:57:44.575 --> 01:57:47.937
If everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon...

01:57:48.037 --> 01:57:50.037
...play the five tones.

01:58:59.149 --> 01:59:01.789
Give her six quavers, then pause.

01:59:02.903 --> 01:59:04.346
She sent us four quavers...

01:59:04.446 --> 01:59:08.846
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

01:59:22.214 --> 01:59:24.533
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

01:59:24.633 --> 01:59:26.382
Hope somebody's
taking all this down.

01:59:26.482 --> 01:59:28.037
What are we saying to each other?

01:59:28.137 --> 01:59:30.998
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

01:59:31.098 --> 01:59:33.418
It's the first day of school.

01:59:40.816 --> 01:59:45.856
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

02:00:00.628 --> 02:00:03.322
We have a translation interlock
on their audio signal.

02:00:03.422 --> 02:00:06.542
We're taking over
this conversation now.

02:01:07.569 --> 02:01:09.569
Let's go. Come on.

02:02:46.126 --> 02:02:48.126
I am Claude Lacombe.

02:02:51.382 --> 02:02:52.950
Frank Taylor...

02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:55.703
...Lieutenant J.G., United States
Navy Reserve...

02:02:55.803 --> 02:02:57.803
...064199.

02:02:57.930 --> 02:03:00.224
Lieutenant, welcome home.

02:03:00.683 --> 02:03:02.683
This way to debriefing.

02:03:02.768 --> 02:03:03.961
Harry Ward Craig...

02:03:04.061 --> 02:03:06.255
...Captain, United States Navy...

02:03:06.355 --> 02:03:08.649
...043431.

02:03:08.857 --> 02:03:12.111
Captain, would you come
right this way?

02:03:13.988 --> 02:03:16.628
Welcome back,
Navy. Welcome back.

02:03:18.367 --> 02:03:21.645
'Craig, Harry Ward.
Captain, United States Navy...

02:03:21.745 --> 02:03:23.789
...0434311.'

02:03:24.081 --> 02:03:27.361
Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

02:03:29.253 --> 02:03:33.449
Matthew McMichael, Lieutenant,
United States Naval Reserve...

02:03:33.549 --> 02:03:35.884
...0909411.
- Lieutenant.

02:03:36.093 --> 02:03:38.093
Good to have you back.

02:03:38.679 --> 02:03:40.889
Furlow, Otis B...

02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:44.260
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy.

02:03:44.268 --> 02:03:47.463
They haven't even aged.
Einstein was right.

02:03:47.563 --> 02:03:50.174
Einstein was probably
one of them.

02:03:50.274 --> 02:03:52.526
Erickson, David A...

02:03:52.735 --> 02:03:56.015
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

02:03:56.113 --> 02:04:00.075
...0639552.

02:04:01.201 --> 02:04:03.579
Henkle, Robert F...

02:04:03.787 --> 02:04:07.207
...Lieutenant J. G.,
United States Navy...

02:04:34.485 --> 02:04:39.573
Went missing July 1955,
Pensacola, Florida.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.740
Monsieur Neary...

02:04:41.825 --> 02:04:43.825
...what do you want?

02:04:46.372 --> 02:04:49.892
I just wanna know that
it's really happening.

02:04:52.836 --> 02:04:57.716
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

02:04:57.925 --> 02:05:01.078
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

02:05:01.178 --> 02:05:03.555
Yes.
- Yes?

02:05:07.309 --> 02:05:09.789
All right, now we have to talk.

02:05:12.273 --> 02:05:14.466
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

02:05:14.566 --> 02:05:17.152
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

02:05:17.361 --> 02:05:20.948
...reported missing April 1976.

02:05:21.782 --> 02:05:24.618
Are they going away?
- Yes.

02:05:28.956 --> 02:05:30.149
Wait a second, wait.

02:05:30.249 --> 02:05:32.872
He says these are ordinary people...

02:05:32.972 --> 02:05:35.446
under extraordinary
circumstances.

02:05:35.546 --> 02:05:38.757
Delores, Rudolph E...

02:05:38.966 --> 02:05:42.553
...reported missing
December '51, Bisbee...

02:05:43.053 --> 02:05:45.053
...Arizona.

02:05:48.559 --> 02:05:50.559
Goodbye.

02:06:00.779 --> 02:06:02.779
Monsieur Neary...

02:06:03.991 --> 02:06:05.991
...I envy you.

02:08:03.861 --> 02:08:06.847
I'm told we can count on your
complete cooperation.

02:08:06.947 --> 02:08:09.558
What's your blood type?
- I don't know.

02:08:09.658 --> 02:08:12.436
What's your birth date?
- December 4th, 1944.

02:08:12.536 --> 02:08:15.147
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

02:08:15.247 --> 02:08:18.527
Is there any liver disease
in your family?

02:09:17.351 --> 02:09:20.004
May the Lord be
praised at all times.

02:09:20.104 --> 02:09:22.965
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

02:09:23.065 --> 02:09:24.466
Show us your ways.

02:09:24.566 --> 02:09:26.594
And lead us along your paths.

02:09:26.694 --> 02:09:30.239
God has given you
his angels charge over you.

02:09:30.489 --> 02:09:34.185
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey...

02:09:34.285 --> 02:09:39.325
...and peaceful days, so that with
your holy angel as a guide...

02:09:39.415 --> 02:09:42.935
...they may safely reach their
destination...

02:13:24.181 --> 02:13:26.181
Bye.
